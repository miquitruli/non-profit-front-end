        <h2>What is our goal?</h2>
        <h4>The Micaella Foundation is a foundation that main goal is to facilitate humanitarian action. 
        When armed conflict breaks out or natural disasters strike, entire communities are affected, disrupting their day-to-day lives and long-term development prospects. Humanitarian aid is designed to save lives and alleviate suffering during and in the immediate aftermath of emergencies, whereas development aid responds to ongoing structural issues, particularly systemic poverty, that may hinder economic, institutional and social development in any given society, and assists in building capacity to ensure resilient communities and sustainable livelihoods. 
        Both humanitarian and development aid are related, and different forms of aid often have both humanitarian and development components.
